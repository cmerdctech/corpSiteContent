<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Goal Oriented Management</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Here's where we start: </b>You are already doing a good job. Nothing's perfect but, your colleagues are taking care of their business. Your customers and other stakeholders are engaged and productive. Nothing about this is about taking you from sucks to good. If you feel like you are already behind the eight ball, broke, unsuccessful and feeling confused, we are not talking about you (sorry).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>The problem we are trying to solve</b> is how to deal with the fact that you have lots of ideas, that you have goals, that you think that you and your colleagues can do more and then you need to keep track of whatever you're doing as you go from abstract goal to getting something done. Worse, these ideas come and go so quickly that it's maddening.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let's pause a moment. Most really inventive people carry notebooks in which they write down every single idea. They know that most of those ideas are absolutely worthless but, they also know that you can't tell which are good until you look back on them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So, the first problem to solve is getting into the habit of recording your goals and ideas as they occur. You realize that only some will be acted upon but you want them tee'd up, ready to go, stored in a place where the distance between writing it down and getting it going is zero.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you get to that idea, you want to be able to keep track of your noodling around. Maybe you want to make a Ben Franklin list, pros/cons. Maybe you want to look at it as technical or marketing advantages with more complicated properties. Perhaps a favorite ROI spreadsheet to do the arithmetic about something important to your creative production.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might later want to ask a colleague or stakeholder for help. You might have gotten to the place where you have identified an important goal. If it requires collaboration, and everything does, then you can share the goal with them. You'll probably have talked on the phone, had lunch or saw them in the hallway but you want a place to compare notes online.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Of course, in the view of a goal oriented manager, there is no hierarchy, only collaboration. That means each of the people sharing a goal has an entire management space that does the same things as another management space. For that goal, every derived management space has a mission, vision, or whatever you want as the properties and methods available to that goal. Everyone that is shared into a goal sees the common management space, or not, depending on how it works. People can share as, for example, a supervising stakeholder who only sees the formal status view (whatever that means to the people who see the edit formal status view).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Planning Ninja</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I'm leaning toward sticking with The Planning Discipline.</span><span class="s1"> Instead of allowing this to be seen as an uninspired adherence to principle, imagine it as ninja stuff. Black ninja suits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No. Not literally. But going with a cool, slightly aggressive tone. We're not people who are like everyone else. We are people that do stuff. We establish goals and collaborate to achieve them. We use the Achievement Manager to exchange ideas. One of the things about us is that we want to be sure that we are actively communicating with each member of a goal in ways that help you all coordinate properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One way to do that is with the (soon to be renamed) Metrics tool. It allows you to add specifics to the idea. Those specifics are intended to be things that require action that affects others, including the outside world. A ninja would become more certain of the correctness of the goal (in likelihood of success, completeness or something else important to the creative process. One way to do that discipline oneself to always write down a brief description of what it looks like if the goal is achieved. Perhaps also ask a question to yourself (and the others who share that goal with you) in the future, eg, "Do we still think that we can accomplish this goal according to plan?"</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, here's another thing a Planning Discipline Ninja (and I remind you, I'm not planning a literal ninja) would do: Communicate with incredible sophistication. There are a lot of things that a Planning Ninja would do that require communicating to achieve the support of the stakeholder community. Things one does include financial reporting, schedule reporting, resource allocation, etc. Everything can be turned into a presentation page. Every presentation page can have a variety of extra stuff, especially comments and links to other presentation (or any other kind) pages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A goal would have the ability to seen in overview with a dash board that allows the management of the guest roles, ie, the public facing website. In addition to the obvious template stuff, basically any element in the entire Management Space can be listened to by a guest role page. Of course, the public facing website would provide a feed to other tools, as well as HTML for humans. All of it subject to cool role-based management with an underlying publishing system to allow editorial control by the members of the goal.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The thing is, your main goal is to empower yourself and the people around you to achieve goals. Nobody can control another person like a productivity puppet. Every activity, in the end, should be a creative activity. You don't want to limit collaborators' ideas by assertions about their process. You don't want other peoples' details in your head. You want to collaborate on creating and developing goals that can be satisfied according to some criterion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the ideas of martial arts is to use the opponents wait or force against you letting him push at the last minute diving in pulling him along the path he was going to go anyway</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The planning Manager allows you to bring people along based on the force of their enthusiasm and engagement. It helps draw out the creativity out of people by treating all business interaction as collaboration. By encouraging people to interact in terms of goals, the achievement manager naturally encourages people to develop multiple agreements about the pursuit of that goal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By treating management feedback as a goal, people tend to see it as something to get right both in the authoring of the goal (thus increasing by in) and description of success<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>not a burden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With buy in and the enthusiasm it engenders, it is reasonable to think that you have created a decent foundation for the fulfillment of a goal in a way that will be reasonably satisfying for all involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By including all stakeholders in the management space as collaborators, the achievement manager treats their interaction as an exchange of goals,too. It also includes the normal security idea as expressed in the roles and their use in the system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For good measure, stakeholders can also take on any other rules, it is in fact incorrect to make a distinction between stakeholder and collaborator except for the emotional state of the user. That's beyond the scope of this project.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Stakeholders can, consequently, slip among roles flexibly. You never stop being a stakeholder. To be a user, you are a stakeholder (though you don't need to be a user to be a stakeholder).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
