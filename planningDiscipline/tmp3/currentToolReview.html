<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>An Accumulation of Bug Reports and Feature Requests</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I want to become an expert in using the Achievement Manager. I figure to document my exploration with an eye to understanding its strengths and providing feedback on the UI. Obviously, bugs will be highlighted. So that these notes can be found, I will use the same title for all the email messages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Today’s report</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I edited my vision. I am using this to conceive a future for the Achievement Manager. I would like you to be able to read the vision that I devised but, I have not been able to find any way to create a link to it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Bug #1: I cannot find a way to send a link to my vision statement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For me, being able to show my work is very important. I thought that creating a presentation is the way to do that. At reporting-&gt;presentations, I found an opportunity to rename my Vision. I revised it to say “The Future” and it shows that in the reorder list.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, when I created a report and put Vision on it, the title did not appear.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Bug #2: The new name of the Vision does not appear on the report.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When I saw that, I realized that the site name is wrong. My intention has changed. I now want it to refer to the Achievement Manager in a romantic way. I went to admin-&gt;sites and clicked on the edit button. It won’t let me rename the site.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Bug #3: There is apparently no way to change the name of the site.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Then I thought, I know, I will send a link to the presentation that displays Vision but shows the words I wrote for The Future. I grabbed the URL and tried it in a different browser. It won’t show it to me because I’m not logged in there.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Feature Request: A presentation (and probably everything else, too) should have a check box that allows it to be viewed by people who are not logged in.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Feature Request: It would be very nice to be able to create as short URL alias for URLs in the site.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">Working on my internal analysis, strengths inevitably suggested weaknesses. I wanted to work on both at once but the tool would not let me.</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Tools should not limit the user to only one active editor per page. Users often want to edit several related things at once. We do not want them to have to copy their strengths/weaknesses into a word processor to get them just so. (As the day wore on, this became really annoying to me.)</span></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">One of my weaknesses, I realized, was more correctly specified as a point of External Analysis. When I went to that tool, I found that the category (marketing) was not there. Turns out I can edit these categories. Several are not relevant to my organization. I set to delete one an got this dialog asking if I want to delete Educational Trends</span><span class="s2">.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">I have entered no data for this topic. I left it there because I was afraid I would ruin other websites.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Don’t show the warning if there is no data for that External Category. Alternately, add text to the warning that makes the scope clear, ie, that deleting the category won’t harm others. (Of course, if it *would* harm others, that’s a bug, a bad bug.)</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Then I realized that there are many more categories in the external list editor than shows on my external analysis page. I was perplexed that I couldn’t see any way to control the visibility of the errant category. Eventually, I thought to edit it. </span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Move Active/Inactive to a separate tool, eg “Edit Delete Visibility”.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Add an indicator of the current visibility status. I eventually had to write down the ones I wanted to get rid of because I got so confused having to click through to find out how it was set in the editor. Eg, “Edit Delete Visibility(visible)”</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p15"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Make the external categories much smaller and more universal.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Then I wondered about district vs site category. I have literally no clue about the difference or what either of those words mean in this context. I tried it out. When I chose ‘site category’, it disappeared from my External Analysis editor even though it was set to ‘active’.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Do something to make the district/site distinction understandable. I can’t suggest what because I don’t have a clue what it means.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Later, I spent awhile thinking about something else. When I came back, the site had logged me out. I had to log back in and try to remember where I left off.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Allow the user to turn off the logout function. This is not a banking website. </span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Remember where I was and take me back there when I return (this probably requires implementation of the ‘bookmarkable’ request from yesterday).</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">I focused on Competition Analysis. I would name something that someone might use instead of the Achievement Manager and the google for awhile to figure out whether I was right. I wished I had a place to store notes and URLs.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Allow the attachment of arbitrary meta-data (comments, files, etc) to any entry. Provide controls to allow the user to specify when it is seen.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Then I looked at the next menu item, Needs. Looking for guidance (the guidance has been very helpful), it just says “to be defined”.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="s1">Bug Report: The explanatory text on the Needs page says “to be defined” and should say something more helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Upgrade the explanatory text to refer to additional information. This might include a user generated forum discussing that topic and/or one that is specific to that customer and it’s stakeholders.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">Winding down for the day, I took a look at the remaining menu selections. I note a couple of things…</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">1) All of the planning pages look pretty much the same. They present a box to type a list of items. Once items are entered, some of them have complex substructures (Objectives, Strategies, Competition Analysis) that is a complete surprise to the user. We need to find a way to let the person know what to expect when these are created both so that they can know what to enter and what additional information is needed. Also, to let them know where certain kinds of information belong.</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">2) We need to strip out the school jargon. District, LCAP, etc are sprinkled through out. This occurs in places where it probably can be turned off but also in places where it can’t, eg, the site/district confusion I mentioned for External Categories. It is very disconcerting to me as a non-education user. </span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">And finally...</span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1">Feature Request: I want to have a single button that will show (then hide) all of the information on the page with each element expanded to show all of its subordinate elements. This should also allow me to show or hide the editing controls so I can more easily read the information to see if it’s balanced and complete. </span></p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1">But don’t get me wrong. I think I am going to love this tool. It is closer to “a place for everything and everything in its place” than any tool I have ever used and that includes a few I have written myself.</span></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p20"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">While entering Objective Metrics, I wanted to add External Priorities. I got an empty box with no information about what to do to make it useful. </span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Bug Report: The Objective-&gt;Metrics-&gt;External Priorities should provide information about how to make it useful including a link to the tool that will allow it to be updated.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Provide basic/starter set of External Priorities.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">I found the menu selection for External Priorities. It has no explanation but I guess that this is a way to objectives and priorities as meta-data with, I assume, that ability to list all of the metrics (and, one hopes, objectives) that are tagged with a particular external priority. </span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Change the order on the External Priority entry panel so that the description comes first. Since this is a creative process, I didn’t know what the code was until after I had figured out a description. I ended up with lots of extra clicking.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Also, make the External Priority Code entry box much smaller than description. Having it be the same size as the description is confusing.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Add some clue to the External Priority system about what the Priority Code is used for and where it appears. I have no idea if I should be careful making them clear or if a serial number would do as well.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">It’s a new day. I logged into the site and ran into another issue. When I log in, I am put into the Cambrian district. Then, I have to choose my district to see my stuff.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Make so that it knows what I am working on and takes me back to that plac</span><span class="s3">e.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">A side note, I think that a better phrase (though I don’t love it yet) for External Priorities would be Ancillary Goals. That is, goals that are not the main objective but are being addressed as well.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">Turns out that inside Metrics there are two controls that say Add Initial and Add Plan Target. The names are confusing. This is contained within a Metric, not a plan. </span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">I entered something into Initial. It said “date and rating are required”. Both had data in them. I chose a different date with the date picker. Said the same thing even though the data is, presumably by definition, correct. I changed the rating to be a number and it saved.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Bug Report: On the Add Initial (presumable the identical Add Plan Target, too), the error message says “date and rating are required” even when they are both specified. Further, it says “required” when the problem is the format of the entry. It also incorrectly complains about the date when the rating is the only field with a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: These items should be renamed to indicate better what they do. “Rating” should be explained. The consequence of the action should not include the word “students”.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Bug Report: No guest user</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Pending Goal list. Each entry has two properties, a sentence and an explanation. Each has one method, Send into Action. (Ahhh! great title.) The Pending Goal list listens to the usual sources, especially text message. Use case: Goal Oriented Leader is in a bar and runs into someone who inspires a really good idea. Instead of waiting, he can send a text message to himself that lands in the Pending Goal list. Email, too. Ie, all the usual inData sources but text first.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Comments on presentation. An online presentation has a button (if the checkbox was set by the guy who made the presentation) that activates comments for that page. That way people can do feedback to presentations. Could eventually have a lot of different feedback tools (survey, checkbox, etc). Would be read or write or not at all based on role or something.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">Ok, this is a problem after all. This thing turns itself off every time I turn my back. Not only does it put me through a login process that does absolutely nothing, I have to navigate back to where I was working (if I remember). I promise, we do not have to worry about my wife sneaking in and editing my valuable rantings behind my back.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Bug Report: The part where I adjust auto-logoff to just this side of never is not there.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">Phew! Getting that off my chest is good. Please, I beg you.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">So, I’m poking around Strategies. I find that I can attach a document to an action.  This is great. I think we should allow the attachment of documents to everything. Then I upload and want to view a document. It wants to save it to my hard drive. Not only does this mean I have to open a program to look at the file, it also means that I have more litter on my hard drive.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Whenever a View Documents list appears, the user should be able to view the document in a browser window whenever possible (ie, if it’s a file type that browsers can use). This should be in addition to the current control which should be related to say Download.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Upload and View Documents should be available almost everywhere. When I am conceiving a vision, I might want to save files and URLs of the things that inspired me. With goals, information about how to measure success might be useful. Etc. Any file or URL should be able to be saved for any element of your plan.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">Trying to think about the dichotomy between actions and strategies, or between goals and activities, I realize that part of the problem is that it appears that goals are all about Metrics when, in reality, they are about both metrics and activities.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Change the goal user interface to open with two subordinate outline sections: Metrics and Strategies. Allow the user to add simple strategy statements to the goal just as they can metrics. The edit button would, for strategies, open up the strategies editor. If the user chooses to associate the strategy with more than one goal, that strategy would appear in more than one Goal-&gt;Strategy list.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="s1">Wait!! I just discovered that the association of goals is only with actions. In my view, the goal is the root of all things. While I’m ok with allowing Strategies and Actions to be created with out a goal, I think that forcing Strategies to always be separate from goals is a mistake. I really don’t understand how anyone would come up with Strategies without a goal to motivate it. This is, imho, a serious flaw.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Add Related Goals to Strategies. This would allow a Strategy to be associated with one or more goals. When a Goal is attached to a Strategy, an option should be presented to attach the goal to the Actions. Perhaps another option should be presented that says that all goals are implicitly associated with the Strategy’s goals. (The point is to allow the user to say that everything in the Strategy is applicable to all the Strategy’s goals, or to allow the user to pick and choose.)</span></p>
<p class="p26"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">Feature Request: Inherit Related Goals up from Actions. When a goal is added to an Action, that goal should be added to that (those) goals should be added to the Strategy. When a Strategy that has some actions that do not share the goal, those actions would be displayed ‘grayed out’ in the Goals-&gt;Strategy listing.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
