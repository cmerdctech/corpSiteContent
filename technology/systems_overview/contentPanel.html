The Back to School data center already supports dozens of
school districts and hundreds of applications. With
high-speed fiber optic connection to the internet and
sophisticated VMware servers, we can provision a new server
in minutes and implement a whole new application suite faster
than you can believe.

<p>
Our uptime record is phenomenal but even better is our tech
support. All day, every day, we are on the job to answer your
calls, adjust your systems and insure that your users are
completely satisfied.

Service, Support and Repair

<p>
You have a lot of equipment and not a lot of people. When
something breaks, you can just feel your week going down the
tubes. Whatever you were going to do, ain't going to get done.
</p>

<p>
Unless, of course, you have made friends with the Innovation
Team. We are happy to support you. We are familiar with
nearly every technology (Microsoft, Apply, Cisco, etc) and
many education applications
</p>.

<p>
We can come to your site or talk to you on the phone. We can
bring our experience with dozens of education data centers to
help you solve your problems.
