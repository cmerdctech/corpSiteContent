<p>
		Our nerds are the best in the business. Ranging from fresh-faced college kids, to gray beards who have seen it all,
		the Innovation Team is able to take your idea and run with it. Have a home-brew program that hasn't kept up with your
		growth, we can take it and make it worthy of your district enterprise.
</p>
		
<p>
		Need to make it work with new systems? The Innovation Team is all over that, too. Our integration group
		knows how to anything up to anything. We do SIF, SOAP, HTTP request, DLL referencing and, if you need it, CSV files.

<p>
		In addition to nerds, the Innovation Team includes educators experienced in the ways of school districts, buildings and
		classrooms. We've taught classes. We've made budgets. We've implemented project in schools across the country. We knows
		the pitfalls and challenges of getting things done with special sensitivity to the issues of school district funding 
		and decision processes.
</p>
		
<p>
		If you have an RFP or need help writing one, the Innovation Team is on your side. 
</p>
		
<p>
		Often, we can help with funding, too. With our shared rewards program, we may be able to solve your Problem
		and apply it to other school districts. If we do, we share the upside!

		Help with Your Amazing Idea
	</div>

	
	<div class='prose'>
<p>
		We've been taking ideas from the blue sky to hard-working production for over twenty years. We can
		help you define your idea and make it fit the real-world needs of a school district. If our Partnership
		flourishes, you can take advantage of our deep ties in the national educational community, integration
		with our popular products and keep your customers happy with our high quality support team.
</p>
		
<p>
		We're always looking for new business partnerships, too. Do you have a product that no longer fits
		your strategy but is doing a good job for its customers. Perhaps we can help with that, too. The Back to School Innovation
		Team is interested in talking over the possiblity of bringing into our portfolio, whether as part of your brand
		or of ours. Everything is on the table including our vast experience, well-respected name and the 
		possibility of great success.
