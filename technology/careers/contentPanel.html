<div class='headline'>
Welcome!
</div>

<div class='prose'>

We don't have any specific openings right now but the Learning Solutions Team is <u>always</u> looking for
terrific people with unique qualifications who are enthusiastic about helping schools
do a great job of educating their students, providing their teachers with
excellent tools and helping administrators make it all work smoothly.
<br/><br/><br/>

<span style='font-weight:bold;'>Here's what we do:</span>
<br/><br/>
1) Programming - We use many different technologies including C#, Javascript and PHP. We use .NET MVC and JavascriptMVC. jQuery appears in almost everything. Increasingly, our applications are browser-based with the server acting as an AJAX appliance. On the server side, we are heavily into nHibernate. We have several systems with complex load-balancing architectures.
<br/><br/>
2) Database - Everything we do is database driven. We use both Microsoft SQL Server and mySQL. You will need to be reasonably fluent in SQL itself and will be happier the more you know about the differences between those two. We also have a data warehousing application that relies on Microsoft Analysis Services.
<br/><br/>
3) Whatever else that shows up that will help us move the ball forward. Some of us are really looking for a place to use Node.js.
<br/><br/><br/>

So, if you see something on this site that interests you and  feel motivated by the idea of improving the world of education better,
to make, please contact <p style='font-weight:bold;'>Chris Anderson, 320-257-1921 or HR@ * or <span class='learnMoreTextBlue'>Click Here <a href='#' class='contactFormButton' buttonId='careers: Contact' formName='careerContact'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></span><p/>
