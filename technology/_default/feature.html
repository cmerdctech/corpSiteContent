 The Back to School Innovation Team has been writing software for
      school districts for over twenty years. Employing a world class
      gang of nerds, we turn them into education experts by exposing
      them to our wide variety of educational software systems and
      support them with an expert group of education professional,
      teachers and managers.<p/>

 In addition to our traditional products, Viewpoint Data Mining,
      Student Plans Education Management system and our Moodle-based
      E-learning system, the Innovation Team is always working on new,
      cool products, from Expressbook, to Engagement Plus to Data
      Integration. <p/>

 We place a premium on technical sophistication and a tight fit
      with the needs of school districts. Our hosting systems are state
      of the art and our ability to help you create technical systems
      onsite is second to none.<p/>

 The Back to School Innovation Team is waiting to hear from you. Whatever your
      problem, Back to School has a solution.
