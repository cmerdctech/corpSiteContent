The Back to School Innovation Team started as a way for school
          districts to share the cost of having access to IT experts on
          staff. We hired world class networking and server admins. We
          built a state of the art data center. Responding to each
          need, Back to School has developed a complete, one-stop-shop for
          your IT infrastructure needs.
