The Back to School Innovation Team started as a way for school
          districts to share the cost of having access to IT experts on
          staff. We hired world class networking and server admins. We
          built a state of the art data center. Responding to each
          need, Back to School has developed a complete, one-stop-shop for
          your IT infrastructure needs.

From hosted servers and networking, to onsite planning and
          implementation, to technical support for your IT staff or
          your users, the Back to School Innovation Team is ready to help
          you move your district into the future.
