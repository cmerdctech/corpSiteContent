When it comes to SIS, lots of experience matters.

For twenty years, the Innovation Team has been connecting
          student information systems to other software. Our SSI
          interface is in use across the country supporting data
          mining, planning systems, e-learning and more. We have
          experience in almost every SIS and are ready to figure out
          more.<p/>

If your district is going for SIF, we can support you there,
          too. We have developed SIF agents for our own products and
          would be happy to develop one for your needs, too. If you're
          just getting started and need to build your system, our Zone
          Information Server technology is a great building block to
          get on your way to success.<p/>
