Viewpoint Reports: Teachers obtain comprehensive, on-demand views to state, nationally-normed and local assessment data, along with student enrollment, demographics, grades, attendance and intervention program data, on every student in their classroom to help inform their instruction.

The data is dynamically refreshed on a district-based schedule.
