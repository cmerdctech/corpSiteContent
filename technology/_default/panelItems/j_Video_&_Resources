Flipped or Not,<br/>Today's Classroom Needs Good Video
</div>

<div class='prose1'>

If there's one thing that has become perfectly clear, it's that today's young students
absorb information more easily with a video presentation. Books might be better but, it's
no longer a choice. Video is the way young people like to learn.

Fortunately, the Innovation Team has been helping schools meet the changing needs of students
since the old days of 16mm film. Now, instead of checking out a film, we provide excellent
online video resources for every learning situation and topic.

Better still, we work with vendors that provide world-class content that is Moodle compatible
and that are thrilled to provide you with a free trial.
