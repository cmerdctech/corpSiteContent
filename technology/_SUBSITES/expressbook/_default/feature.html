	Expressbook is a comprehensive, school district, <a href='teachers'>gradebook solution</a> that also generates report cards.

Expressbook was created in close collaboration with a committee of teachers. We thought, 
"Many teachers really like the grading book they have been using for years. They have 
habits for how it is annotated and how it is organized. It is used for many things other
than marking." So, our first goal was to do everything paper grading books do in a way
that was so much quicker, easier and cooler so that adoption would be a no-brainer.
<br/><br/>
We know that one of the main hassles of daily classroom life is following the complicated
requirements of the school district's curriculum committee. Entering and organizing the
mandatory assessments and activities takes a lot of time and leads to confusion. We wanted
Expressbook to take that hassle off the teacher.

Automatically Ready for the Teacher
</div>
When a teacher is assigned a homeroom, Expressbook already has every district requirement
in place. Of course, teachers can create their own assignments, too.
<br/><br/>
But, our teachers made clear: grading books are also used to organize field trips, take notes
about students, coordinate with specialty teachers, and many other small things. We wanted
Expressbook to do that job, too.
<br/><br/>
Expressbook includes special marks scales that are just text 
so that teachers can keep track of anything they want about each student. It allows 
a comment to be added to any mark. New columns can be added for any purpose whatsoever, not just 
homework.

Easy, Quick Collaboration
</div>


Even cooler, though, is that Expressbook allows the selection of some students and the creation
of who new temporary 'class' by choosing some or all of the assessments and activities 
and turning them into a whole new grading book. This new subset of students and assessments can
even be delegated to another teacher.
<br/><br/>
Working with a math specialist? Select the students with the best scores, choose some of the
math activities the teacher or district have put into Expressbook for the class, and tell
the system that the math specialist can mark those students. Bingo! A convenient way to 
collaborate with other teachers to insure the best outcomes for students.
<br/><br/>
The marks are visible to both the homeroom teacher and the specialist. The new list can
be set to expire at some date in the future so you don't even have to worry about getting rid of it 
when its purpose is over. It is incredibly easy to use!

District-Teacher Communication
</div>


For administration, Expressbook allows the creation of unlimited kinds of marks scales. It 
has a very efficient class generator that allows the creation of specialty classes derived
from homerooms, grade levels or even an entire school. The curriculum editor organizes 
assessments and activities in an outline-like structure that can go as deep as necessary
but still provide a simple experience for the teacher. Each group of assessments and activities 
can be assigned to multiple grades - with a different mark scale and performance flag set 
for each.


<div class='subTitle'>
Connects to Everything!
</div>


Expressbook interfaces to most student information systems by way of the the Back to School 
Data integration product (Integration info <a href='http://data.<!baseDomain!>'><span style='font-size:80%;'>HERE</span></a>).
It can exchange data with our Back to School data mining product, Viewpoint (Viewpoint info <a href='http://viewpoint.<!baseDomain!>'><span style='font-size:80%;'>HERE</span></a>).
<br/><br/>
And our 
Notify! reporting and report card system is included with every installation of Expressbook.
That's right, Expressbook includes a full report card output system.
