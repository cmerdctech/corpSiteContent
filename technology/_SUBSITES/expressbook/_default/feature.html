<p>Expressbook is a comprehensive, school district, gradebook solution.</p>

<p>Integrated with almost every SIS, Expressbook allows district specification of educational standards and objects that result in a complete, initialized gradebook
for every teacher. </p>

<p>A rich feature set allows district administrators to be certain that teachers are collecting exactly the
measurements required. Even more features make Expressbook a fast, easy, helpful tool for teachers.</p>

<!--Standards and measurable activities can be assigned to as many grade levels as appropriate and marks
scales can have colored performance flags that vary by grade level.

<p> </p>

<p>It even helps teachers work together. Expressbook's sophisticated student organizing tool allows (at the district's
discretion) teachers to review student performance for the entire grade level in their buildings. Or, to
create <i>ad hoc</i> groupings for reading groups, field trips, or any other purpose. Permission to view
newly created groups can be assigned to other teachers (specialists, student teachers, etc) and those
teachers can be granted permission to enter marks for selected standards and activities.</p>

<p>Expressbook works with the Back to School Innovations Data Integration suite and can receive data from
almost any SIS and send data as well. It has solid integration with Viewpoint, Technology Systems' premier
data mining tool. </p>
