Once Expressbook has been configured (standards, schools, etc), it receives information about students, teachers and homerooms from a Student Information System.
As a result, teachers can log in and see their gradebook. There can be more than one of them, of course, if the teacher has multiple classes. 
<br/><br/>
At the first use, the teacher sees a list of standards in an outline form and gets to decide what to
look at first. He or she chooses a subject and the grade book opens it up into a marking grid.
<br/><br/>
The marking grid is the heart of data collection. Each row refers to one student. Each column refers
to one activity. At first, the only activities showing are those defined by the district. Some of those
are marked mandatory and others are just suggestions or bookkeeping helpers. Soon, the teacher will want 
to enter homework (or other assessable activities).
