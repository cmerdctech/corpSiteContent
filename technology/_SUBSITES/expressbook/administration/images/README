You can put javascript into:

/_GLOBAL/JS/file.js 

or

in a page directory as

jqueryReadyScript.js 

In both cases, the result is put inside a $.ready() so it will execute after
the page load.

You can put page specific CSS into a page directory in a file named

thisPage.css

it is added to the CSS chain last.
