A Generally Useful Tool
</div>

The entire Expressbook system is organized around gradebooks. In fact, there is a district gradebook that refers
to every student and every standard in the system. (You can't actually see or use it because
it's not practical to show tens of thousands of students in a web browser.)
<br/><br/>
More practically, 
the system creates a master gradebook for every school. Typically, there is an admin who
has access to the school gradebooks. The system also generates a gradebook for each grade
level, too. The admin usually has access to these, too.
<br/><br/>
Based on these, the school office is able to create gradebooks for many purposes using 
the same tool that teachers use. They can create special watch lists for the principle. 
Student committees. Field trips. Each can have comments and special columns to help track
the students in the situation.

Specialty Classes
</div>

Generally with Expressbook, Homeroom assignments come from the Student Information System. Specialty Classes
don't. That leaves each building admin to figure out who is teaching which students music, art,
gym, etc. This is a truly laborious process that Expressbook makes easy with an awesome tool that allows
the assignment of teachers to groups of students, by the classroom, grade level or school.





<div class='subTitle'>
The Usual
</div>

Of course, Expressbook also provides tools to edit users (though teachers usually come from the SIS)
and choose whether their passwords are
local or LDAP, assign them to schools, choose roles for them (a different one for each
building they work in), disable access to Expressbook.
