Report Cards
</div>

Expressbook integrates with Notify!, our student information reporting system. It supports 
different report cards for each grade level. For users of our EEPR product, existing report card
layouts can be imported. Responding to a lesson we learned with EEPR, the report card print server 
can run on a separate server to prevent bringing the rest of the system to a halt at the 
end of the term.
