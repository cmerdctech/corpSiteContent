Delegated Gradebooks
</div>

Whether it's team teaching or working with specialists, no student is an island any more and Expressbook is
built to help. A teacher can create an <i>ad hoc</i> gradebook from any subset of students in any
of his or her gradebooks and <u>any subset of the standards and activities</u> in that gradebook.
<br/><br/>
That gradebook can be used for personal reasons. It might be useful to segregate students by reading level
for marking or just for convenience in some other way. But, in Expressbook, those gradebooks can also be
delegated to other teachers for marking.
<br/><br/>
Perhaps there is a new reading specialist in your school. Working together to evaluate which
students would benefit, the Homeroom teacher and the Specialist might agree on a list of
children for the new program and standards and activities that will be taught
by the specialist.
<br/><br/>
The Homeroom teacher can select those students, the specific standards and activities
and send the resulting gradebook to the Specialist. He or she can use that gradebook to
record comments and marks. Those marks are visible to the homeroom and, if appropriate
fed to the report card.
<br/><br/>
If the program has a specific time frame, the new gradebook can be set to expire at the
end of the time. Keeping the assessment process under the control of the originating teacher.
