		<p>These are just some of the ways our member districts and cooperatives have chosen to implement our Learning Plans solution. Because it’s so customizable, it has an unlimited number of applications. We work with each individual user to set up exactly the learning plan they want for any individual, group, grade, subject, school, District or group of Districts. Some schools use several plans with-in the same building. How can we help you?</p>
		Assessment data can be imported into Learning Plans if Viewpoint or TRAX are available; providing test results, by individual, from Kindergarten through 12th grade in linear or graphic format.</br>
