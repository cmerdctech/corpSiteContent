"The selling point for our cooperative is the unparalleled customer service. Special education staff is no longer frustrated by having to deal with technology "glitches" when attempting to produce compliant special education documents. Staff is able to attend regularly scheduled webinar sessions, without the added travel cost, in order to become more proficient with the software. Due to this level of support, new staff can also quickly become familiar with the software. The customer service is simply superb!"

	<div class='quotation'>"The Completeness Check is one of the most important features to our district. It has vastly improved our compliance when we do our self-monitoring.
The Student System Interface is a great timesaver as it totally eliminates the need for anyone to enter data regarding the student.
Since not all districts use forms in the same way, it is wonderful to have the ability to customize documents to fit what you want to do in your district."
