Tracking requests for special transportation of students is a breeze with Student Plans.  Electronic Transportation Requests optimizes the communication between your special education case managers, 504 plan coordinators and health professionals with your transportation department.  Special verification procedures allow these coordinators to verify all special transportation needs for the start of summer school or the regular school year with a minimum of effort.
