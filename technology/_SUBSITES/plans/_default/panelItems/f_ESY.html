Tracking special education students in need of extended school year services has never been easier.  Student Plan IEPs can document the criteria by which students qualify for ESY services.  A full registration system allows case managers to electronically register students.  A dashboard interface lets your registration staff track and manage your ESY needs.  Student Plans reporting make IEP goals, objectives and progress reporting available to ESY teachers via electronic or paper reports.   Students can be happy to attend school in the summer!
