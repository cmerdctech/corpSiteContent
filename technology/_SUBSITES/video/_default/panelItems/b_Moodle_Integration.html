		Our video content products are fabulous in the classroom, that's for sure. Students
		are more engaged and retain more from video than any other information presentation
		medium. But more and more, teachers want to spend their classroom time engaged with
		students, working on higher-level skills and making sure each student is learning at 
		his or her own optimal pace.
</p>

		Enter Moodle, today's premier tool for remote education. Schools around the country 
		are using it to engage students who can't come to a building. But, teachers are also
		using Moodle to extend the classroom to the student's home. Whether in a formal, 
		district-wide program or as a tool to allow on teacher to reach students at home,
		excellent educational content is the key to better student engagement.

		Both Learn360 and Discovery Education offer excellent integration with Moodle allowing
		you to generate lessons based on video with style and grace.
