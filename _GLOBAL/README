At the site level, components in the page directory overwrite corresponding components
in the _GLOBAL/COMPONENTS directory. That is not the case at the superGlobal level.

Everything in this directory is written to the resulting page. It is written first so 
that any corresponding elements at the site or page level can, if appropriate, supercede
it. Of course, that's often not meaningful but, if it is, it will happen.
