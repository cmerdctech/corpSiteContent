<h1>About Us</h1> <br />

Ten Sigma was founded in 1992 by John Wessels and Clyde Birkholz, both former teachers and school administrators, 
to provide educators with better and more useful tools to help them educate their students. Wessels 
studies education-related research and works with educators to determine what's working and what's not, and then uses 
that information to develop practical, usable products that aim to share the best practices in education with a 
wider audience.
<br /><br />
<h2>Our Mission</h2><br />

Our mission is to bridge the gap between educational theory and the day-to-day realities of the classroom by 
providing schools and school districts with practical, concrete tools they can use to teach, assess, and better
 ensure student success.
<br /><br />
<h2>A Nonprofit Organization</h2><br />

Ten Sigma is a federally tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation. All monies from the sale of Ten Sigma
 materials and services are used to continue research and development of more and better tools to aid educators.
