	<h1>Research-Based Transition Skills</h1><br />
	In developing the transition skills related to the program, Ten Sigma used information from a variety of sources, including:<br />
		<ul style="list-style: disc outside none;">
			<li>SCANS (Secetary's committee on Achieving Needed Skills)</li>
			<li>WRC (Work Readiness Credential)</li>
			<li>Workkeys (research-based certification of adult work skills)</li>
			<li>CASAS (standardized adult work skills assessment)</li>
			<li>World Health Organization (wellness and other life skills)</li>
			<li>Boys Town Skills (socialization and life and employability skills)</li>
		</ul> <br />
	The research was analyzed by special education practitioners who recommended which skills should be included in each of the four program levels.
	<br />
	The program was pilot-tested in a variety of settings and is constantly updated, particularly as the expectations of Indicator 13x become clearer.
