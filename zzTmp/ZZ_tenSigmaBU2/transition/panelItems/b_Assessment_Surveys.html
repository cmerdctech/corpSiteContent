<h1>Assess Transition Needs</h1> <br />

Use an <a href="transitionrubrics/?id=surveys">assessment survey</a> to identify transition strengths and needs.  The manual contains eight transition surveys, two for each of the four groups of student (two mild, two moderate, two severe, two autism spectrum.).  One of the surveys has a Strength/Need scale and one survey has a 5-1 Likert scale.  Each survey contains a listing of all skills separated by category and a place to score the survey.
