<div>
TABBED DISPLAY ELEMENT: edit panelItems/a_Demo_Slide_1.html to customize<br/>
<br/>
remember:<br/>
<br/>
1) You can put images in the images directory. Show them in the normal way:<br/>&lt;img src='images/imageFileName.png'&gt;<p/>
2) You can add additional .html files into the slideShow directory if you need more slides.<p/>
3) Slides are shown in the same order they appear in the file system, ie, alphabetically.<br/>Hence, the prefix 'a_'.<p/><p/>
<b>4) Unlike the slideshow in multiPanel, the file names for this component are structured to also support naming the tabs.

Using underscore as a delimiter, the first element is the file system sequence. After that, the rest is used for the tab label.<br/>
After stripping the first part ("a_") the system will convert underscore to space.

Eg, b_Tab_Label appears on the tab as 'Tab Label' (without apostrophes, of course).
