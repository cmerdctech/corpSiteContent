<b>Trial rubrics</b> contain scales that allow the user to track three, four, five, or more sets of trials.  The user puts the student into a situation where they have to use the skills of the rubric.  Then tally student success in using the skills. 
</p>
<p>When trial scales are used, the results of a series of trials is documented using the trial rubrics, with the results (actual score or whether the trials revealed the student made adequate progress) being displayed on the progress rubric.
