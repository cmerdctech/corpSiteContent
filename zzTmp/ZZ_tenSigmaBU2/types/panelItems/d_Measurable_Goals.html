The assessment rubric is an excellent tool for identifying the present level and goal level of an annual goal. The progress rubric is effective for measuring quarterly progress. These rubrics are particularly effective for functional skills.  The following steps are used to apply an assessment rubric as the basis of an annual goal.
<br />
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal; margin-left: 25px;">
	<li>identify a need to be met as an annual goal</li>
	<li>locate the rubric associated to the need</li>
	<li>assess the student on each of the criteria of the rubric and score each item using the proficiency scale</li>
	<li>total the score for each group of criteria and the rubric as a whole</li>
	<li>determine which areas, if any are justified to include in an annual goal</li>
	<li>use the results of the assessment to write the present level for the annual goal</li>
	<li>use the &quot;acceptable&quot; level of the rubric to set the goal for the annual goal</li>
	<li>use the progress rubric to assess quarterly PROGRESS</li>
</ol>
