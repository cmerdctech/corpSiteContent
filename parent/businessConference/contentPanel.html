			<p>cmERDC&#39;s Administrative Service Team would like to invite you to our 20th  
                        Annual Business Conference.  We will begin the day with a motivational session 
                        from Joe Schmidt, reporter for KSTP.  As our keynote speaker he will inspire us 
                        to embrace the power of our own influence.   Once we are all motivated we will 
                        then start our breakout session which will surely include the always popular 
                        MDE Updates, PERA &TRA, ACA Update, MARSS Reporting information and much more.  
                        There might even be something special to commemorate our 20th Anniversary!
                     </p>

			<p>Don&#39;t miss out; we hope to see you there!
                     </p>
                     <p>Additional information will be available soon.  Please watch your emails or check back here.
