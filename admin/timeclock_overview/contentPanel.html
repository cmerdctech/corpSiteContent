	<div class='title'>Integrate with SMART HR or Export Files</div>
	<div class='description'>
		The payroll process can be simplified greatly by the creation of an export file for hours worked, overtime earned, and paid leaves.  A second export file can be created to record any leave type based on your specific school’s needs.  Both files can be easily imported in SmartHR.   The outdated process of manually entering Timesheets per employee is now a thing of the past.
