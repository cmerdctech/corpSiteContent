	<div class='title'>Integrate with SMART HR or Export Files</div>
	<div class='description'>
		The payroll process can be simplified greatly by the creation of an export file for hours 
              worked, overtime earned, and paid leaves.  A second export file can be created to record 
              any leave type based on your specific school’s needs.  Both files can be easily imported 
              in SmartHR.   The outdated process of manually entering Timesheets per employee is now 
              a thing of the past.  In addition, your employee demographic data can now be imported from 
              SMARTHR directly to TimeClock Plus.  Key your new employee data and pay and leave codes 
              in one place with automated feeds updating TimeClock Plus.

		The <b>Benefit Status Monitor</b> for TimeClock Plus gives employers the ability to flag employees 
              as full-time or part-time/variable hour within the program as well as define measurement 
              period.  The software will allow managers to instantly generate reports that show how close 
              an employee is on their hours. The report will also feature a cumulative total for hours 
              across the measurement period, allowing managers ultimate flexibility in scheduling employees 
              while making sure they do not go over an hourly threshold.  The <b>Benefit Status Monitor</b> will 
              send out regular text and e-mail alerts to managers when an employee is coming close to their 
              hourly threshold across the week, month, or measurement period. The amount of time necessitating 
              a report can be set on each individual employee. These alerts will allow managers to make 
              informed decisions on the fly in regards to workforce management by ensuring that there are 
              enough employees available while smartly managing hours to keep under the measurement threshold.
