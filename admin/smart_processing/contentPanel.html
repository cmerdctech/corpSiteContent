	<div class='title'>Purchasing</div>
	<div class='description'>
		The Purchasing module offers flexibility for the user.  One can begin the process with a Request for Quotation, move the successful bid to a Requisition, and move the approved Requisition to a Purchase Order.  Or the user can begin with the Purchase Order alone. <p/>If the District is using the online SMARTeR for employee access, staff can be individually authorized to initiate purchasing transactions from their internet-connected device.  Staff can access the websites of selected vendors to shop their catalogs and capture product descriptions and accurate pricing or they can key their request in a format that allows them to specify any vendor, description and price.  Either way, the staff is able to add notes and GL coding information.  This information is transferred to the Requisition or PO document in the finance system.  <p/>Open Purchase Orders will show on GL reports as being encumbered, so users can see the effect of obligations in addition to posted expenditures.  Requisitions and Purchase Orders viewed on-screen highlight detail lines when they would cause an over budget condition for an expense code.<p/>Districts have the option to route Requisitions and Purchase Orders for electronic approvals.  Purchase Orders can be automatically signed (password protected) when printed. <p/>Copies of closed Purchase Orders can be generated as a new PO in a subsequent month for recurring activites.

	<div class='title'>Payroll Processing</div>
	<div class='description'>
		The payroll module allows you to automate the contract rate of pay information into a salary schedule resembling the information included in the contract settlement materials. The calculation of payroll is dependent upon pay and deduction and benefit codes that meet the regulations for pension reporting all the way through calendar year end W-2 reporting. The taxing tables for FIT and SITMN and surrounding states are maintained as annual calculations. The expenditures for the accounting system are generated in the payroll system based upon gross pay distribution. The deductions and benefits are included in an automated voucher process used in the accounting system. The correction of gross pay distribution is automated in the exception processing module in payroll, with an automatic interface into the accounting system.
