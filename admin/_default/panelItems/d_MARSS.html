The key to funding.  Accurate student reporting.  cmERDC can help.

<p class='prose'>
The Minnesota Automated Reporting Student System (MARSS) collects data from all districts
which is used by a variety of departments within the Minnesota Department of Education and
and Federal offices for funding and demographic information.
</p><p class='prose'>
When you are a member district, we provide advice on correct coding, making sure you have reported all
of your students correctly, sending applicable reports, and ensure that your data is submitted to MDE on time and error free by the final submission. We offer two main trainings each year; Fall and EOY. We also offer trainings as new MARSS procedures or fields are added aside from FALL & EOY training timelines.
</p><p class='prose'>
With the many procedures and data items required for MARSS and all of the changes that legislation
adds or makes changes to, we attend the trainings and teleconferences to assist in keeping our districts informed, up to date, and trained as needed.
