“Our school district has used the services of the shared accountant for over 30 years.  We have always appreciated the expertise they bring, especially at year end.  I would recommend them to any school especially those that might be short staffed and need the extra eyes catching things I may have missed. “- <span class='attribution'>Kathy Nelson, Finance Manager - Mora Public Schools</span>

“I would love to go on record saying that the Smart Software is very user friendly and great to work with.  But most importantly, the support you receive when you have questions is awesome.  I know that I can always get help or support.  It makes a difference, especially when you're in a time crunch.” - <span class='attribution'>Carol Weber, Princeton Public School</span>s

“I would like to say that the many years I have been working on the Smart System for Accounts Payable, if I ran into a problem, the support staff there have responded quickly and never leave you hanging till the next day.  You get a live person on the line too!  They are a very knowledgeable group and some of the nicest people you will encounter.”
