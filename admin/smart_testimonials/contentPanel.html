<div class='quotation'>“Our school district has used the services of the shared accountant for over 30 years.  We have always appreciated the expertise they bring, especially at year end.  I would recommend them to any school especially those that might be short staffed and need the extra eyes catching things I may have missed. “<span class='attribution'>- Kathy Nelson, Finance Manager - Mora Public Schools</span></div>
<div class='quotation'>“I have worked with shared accountants since 1992 when I started in the Bookkeeping position.  I have went through several shared accountants and they have all been excellent.  I feel having a shared accountant come into the district approximately 6 times a year just helps to reassure me that my books are all in order for when auditors are ready to come to our district. <p/> I have had auditors comment that my books are in order and it is so easy to audit due to the shared accountants helping with the accounting services.<p/>I would recommend to any district to utilize the ERDC shared accountants as they have the knowledge and expertise that I just don't seem to find time to read.  They are always just a phone call away if help is needed. This is an excellent service provided by ERDC and hopefully will continue.<p/>Thank you ERDC for all your help.” <span class='attribution'>- Ann Wachlin , Office Manager - Bertha -Hewitt Schools<p/></span></div>
