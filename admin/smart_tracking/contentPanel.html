	<div class='description'>
		In this current economic climate budgeting accurately is a necessity.  SMART Systems can help you produce accurate budget information so you can make educated decisions.  Payroll expenses are the largest part of your budget so we have focused on making that an efficient process,  annual calc will do just that.  With the click of a few buttons and some training from cmERDC you can annualize all your salaries and then manipulate  amounts for contract settlement and benefit rate increases.  Once that staff budget is set you can export that data  by account code and complete the remainder of the budget.
