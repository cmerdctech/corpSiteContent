SMARTeR is the online access for employees to their data in SMART Systems. Employees can view their paychecks, leave activity and balances, flexible benefit information, and print their own W-2’s. Districts can customize employee access to include updating their address and contact information, training, education, licensure, and emergency contacts. Employees can also be granted additional access to various reports, an announcements feature, or to complete the Supervisor’s Report of Accident (SRA).
