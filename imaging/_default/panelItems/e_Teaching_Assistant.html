Educators are under continuous pressure to find new and innovative ways to improve student 
achievement while reducing cost. These initiatives are not unique to school districts. 
Every enterprise, from public and private schools to large corporations, must become more 
efficient. To assist in these mission critical initiatives Kyocera has developed 
Teaching Assistant, a business application, powered by HyPAS that transforms your Kyocera 
MFP into an on-demand test creating, grading and analysis hub.
