	STREAMLINE CLASSROOM WORKFLOW AND BOOST STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT  Educators are under continuous pressure to find new and innovative ways to improve student achievement while reducing cost. These initiatives are not unique to school districts. Every enterprise, from public and private schools to large corporations, must become more efficient. To assist in these mission critical initiatives Kyocera has developed Teaching Assistant, a business application, powered by HyPAS that transforms your Kyocera MFP into an on-demand test creating, grading and analysis hub.
