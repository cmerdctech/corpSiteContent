Layouts are defined by the system. They include code and are very fussy, technical things.

This is where many of the colors and styles of the site are defined. Since they have code,
they need to be created by a programmer. If you are not one of those, you should not
mess around here.

If you are, start with a template from the layouts directory in the Zend code system. They
are associated with page types but not on a one-to-one basis. Most use 'layout.phtml'. The
rest are for unusual circumstances.

Good luck.
